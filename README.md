"wannabe tempest"

a tempest (arcade game) clone in java, and a small project for playing with git.

playable, and fairly true to the original, though not a full feature-complete clone.  the crawler, some of the levels, the red X's and square pods, spikes, spinnies, etc are here, and function mostly like in the original.  the superzapper, sound, and the high score board, as well as some of the level layouts, are missing.

##### to build, using ant build file:
    $ ant

##### to run:
    $ java -jar wbtempest.jar


###### Or without ant, ghetto it:
    $ cd src 
    $ javac wbtempest/*
    $ java wbtempest.WBTempest


control is via arrow keys and spacebar.
