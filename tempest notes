jul 10 '13 : added exes and primitive detection btw player and ex, and missile and ex.
exes

jul 11: made exes move columns. started adapting for consecutive levels and lives.  seems to work at moment, though i should do something to make it clear that youve died, or advanced to the next level.

jul 12: levels, endlevel animation pov skews in, firing to 6.  score and lives on display.

jul 14: added two more frames to ex jumping, enabled playability during levelclear sequence


next:

spikes

spinnies on spikes

make levels loop through, just more exes and spikes - kinda done, jusst no spokes

high score

new levels - something weird

vims? to coolect for extra life?

something that slows down the exes

superzapper?
