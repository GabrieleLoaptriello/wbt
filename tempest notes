exes

jul 11: made exes move columns. started adapting for consecutive levels and lives.  seems to work at moment, though i should do something to make it clear that youve died, or advanced to the next level.

jul 12: levels, endlevel animation pov skews in, firing to 6.  score and lives on display.

jul 14: added two more frames to ex jumping, enabled playability during levelclear sequence

jul 15: added spikes and holding level state on death.  added spinners.  added more board levels.
