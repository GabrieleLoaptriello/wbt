jul 10 '13 : added exes and primitive detection btw player and ex, and missile and ex.
exes

jul 11: made exes move columns. started adapting for consecutive levels and lives.  seems to work at moment, though i should do something to make it clear that youve died, or advanced to the next level.

jul 12: levels, endlevel animation pov skews in, firing to 6.  score and lives on display.

next:

github

add frames to ex flipping, it's too jumpy now
spikes

spinnies on spikes

kill missiles on player death....bug?  sometimes missiles stay

make levels loop through, just more exes and spikes - kinda done, jusst no spokes


high score

new levels - something weird

make exes fire

vims? to coolect for extra life?

something that slows down the exes

superzapper?
